                <br>
                This is probably not what you were expecting (the other thing didn't pan out) but I will make this as romantic as possible. So, it's the month of February now and this is what you've been waiting for.
                But first, I just want to take a moment to appreciate you. You've been the most amazing girlfriend ever, loved, appreciated, cared for and made me feel like
                no one else and I'm literally the luckiest guy in the whole wide world. You've made me feel things I never thought I would ever feel.
                Thank you for being mine, thank you for putting in the effort for me, I will forever love you for that.</p>
